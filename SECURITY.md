## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us responsibly. Don't announce it in public places like GitHub issues or the forum. You can get in contact with us by:

* writing an email to bugs@e621.net (preferred)
* creating a vulnerability report on the e621ng repository ([link](https://github.com/e621ng/e621ng/security/advisories/new))

Don't report through on-site DMails or Discord DMs, the two options above ensure that multiple people are notified. Include as much information as you can to help us understand the issue.
